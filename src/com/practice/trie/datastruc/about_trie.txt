Trie is data structure used for efficient retrieval of a key in a huge set of strings.
In binary search tree, node in the tree	stores the key associated with that node.

In Trie, node's position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated and the key is
associated with the leaves.
It is also known as prefix tree because, all descendants of the node have a common prefix of the string
associated with the node. The root is associated with empty string.

Trie representation:
The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes.
Each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the alphabet.
Node also maintains a flag which tells whether it is end of the key or not.
